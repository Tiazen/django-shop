The main purpose of this repository is to practice some django, rest and docker maybe some frontend.

## Idea:  
The main goal is to create a platform like shopify where people can create a shop and sell something in it. They can easily add items, photos, descriptions. Can communicate with customers via chat. Can accept payments.
